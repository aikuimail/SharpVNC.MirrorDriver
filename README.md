SharpVNC Mirror Driver is a Windows 2000 Display Driver Model (XDDM) [mirror driver](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/display/mirror-drivers) for the Graphics Device Interface (GDI). Mirror drivers enable **fast and efficient** access to the Windows framebuffer, although were made obsolete from Windows 8 onwards. SharpVNC Core has **built-in** support for the mirror driver, and it can also be licensed in binary or source form depending on the use cases required.
